# CSE412_Lab6_JTesting

Hello world,
I have created a new Monthly Expense Tracer. I did not connected with any database to store the informations. You have to manually input the data for example 

in the main file Lab6.java

Expense e1 = new Expense("Lunch", 12.5, LocalDate.now(), food, creditCard); //input your data in these sections
Expense e2 = new Expense("Groceries", 45.0, LocalDate.now(), food, creditCard);
